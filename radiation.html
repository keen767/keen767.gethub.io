						This lesson will focus on X-Ray formation at the atomic level, describing how X-Rays are produced through the

					<h1><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>

					<p>
							The production of X-Rays involves three steps:<br>
							Firstly, there must be a source of free electrons.<br>
							Secondly, those electrons are accelerated from rest, directed at a
							large piece of metal, usually tungsten.<br>
							Thirdly, those electrons are decelerated as they pass through
							the metal via interactions at the atomic level,
							and in the process release the energy lost through deceleration
							in the form of X-Ray radiation.
					</p>

					<p>
							The process by which electrons are accelerated will be covered more in
							depth in the following lesson on the X-Ray tube.<br>
					</p>

					<p>
							There are two interactions that occur during the deceleration of
							electrons that cause X-Rays to be produced. The first is the Bremsstrahlung process
							and the second is Characteristic radiation, and we cover them below.
					</p>

					<h1><a name="bremsstrahlung" id="bremsstrahlung"></a>Bremsstrahlung</h1>

					<p>
							Bremsstrahlung is a german word composing <em>bremsen</em> and <em>strahlung</em>, meaning "to decelerate/brake" and "radiation" respectively.
							As the name would suggest, bremsstrahlung a process which involves electrons braking, or decelerating.
					</p>

					<p>
							It is common knowledge that opposite atomic charges experience an attractive force,
							and negatively charged electrons orbiting the nucleus are attracted to positively
							charged protons that reside within the nucleus. When we accelerate electrons
							towards a metallic material, the electrons will pass between the atoms in the material,
							and when they pass close to a nucleus, they are deflected from their original path
							towards the nucleus and "braked" by the attractive force they experience
							from the protons in the nucleus. The energy lost by the deceleration
							is released in the form of X-Ray photons, but not all electrons will produce
							photons of equal energy.
					</p>

					<p>
							Consider the following diagram. The closer an electron is the to
							nucleus, the stronger the attractive force it experiences from the
							protons in the nucleus (illustrated by intensity of the red),
							and as a result, the more deflection it will
							experience as it passes by the nucleus. The more deflection it
							experiences, the more kinetic energy of the electron is lost as it
							decelerates, and the released X-Ray photon will be of a higher energy level.
							This also implies that we can infer that the maximum possible photon energy
							is the same as the energy of the incident electron, as we cannot
							release more energy than the kinetic energy of the electron passing
							near the nucleus.
					</p>
					<img src="images/braking_radiation_2.png" alt="braking radiation 2" title="braking radiation 2" class="diagram"/>

					<p>
							We note that the energy level of the released X-Ray photon is inversely proportional to
							the electron's distance from the nucleus, in other words, the farther
							away from the nucleus the electron is, the lower the energy of the photon
							released. If we mark the regions around the nucleus as bands of concentric
							circles, we find that the regions farthest from the nucleus are also the
							regions with the largest area, this means that there is a higher probability
							that an electron will pass through the outer spheres of the nucleus's influence (creating more photons),
							and a lower chance that an electron will pass very near the nucleus itself (creating less photons).
							With the two observations, we can conclude that as the photon energy decreases,
							the number of photons produced increases.
					</p>

					<img src="images/braking_radiation_3.png" alt="braking radiation 2" title="braking radiation 3" class="diagram"/>

					<p>
						Combining our above knowledge, we notice that the Bremsstrahlung spectrum
						has a maximum photon energy equal to the maximum possible kinetic energy of the incident electrons.
						Past that point, the number of photons produced increases as the photon energy
						decreases.
					</p>


					<h1><a name="characteristic" id="characteristic"></a>Characteristic X-Rays</h1>

					<p>
							Characteristic X-Rays involve the accelerated electrons colliding with
							an electron in the inner valence shell of the atoms, causing the outer electrons
							to drop shells in order to fill the vacancy, in the process losing energy.
							This lost energy is emitted in the form of characteristic radiation.
