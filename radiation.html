					<h1><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>

					<p>
							The production of X-Rays involves three steps:<br>
							Firstly, there must be a source of free electrons.<br>
							Secondly, those electrons are accelerated from rest, directed at a
							large piece of metal, usually tungsten.<br>
							Thirdly, those electrons are decelerated as they pass through
							the metal via interactions at the atomic level,
							and in the process release the energy lost through deceleration
							in the form of X-Ray radiation.
					</p>

					<p>
							The process by which electrons are accelerated will be covered more in
							depth in the following lesson on the X-Ray tube.<br>
					</p>

					<p>
							There are two interactions that occur during the deceleration of
							electrons that cause X-Rays to be produced. The first is the Bremsstrahlung process
							and the second is Characteristic radiation, and we cover them below.
					</p>

					<h1><a name="bremsstrahlung" id="bremsstrahlung"></a>Bremsstrahlung</h1>

					<p>
							Bremsstrahlung is a german word composing <em>bremsen</em> and <em>strahlung</em>, meaning "to decelerate/brake" and "radiation" respectively.
							As the name would suggest, bremsstrahlung is a process which involves electrons braking, or decelerating.
					</p>

					<img src="images/braking_radiation.png" alt="braking radiation" title="braking radiation" width=150px class="articleimg" />

					<p>
							It is common knowledge that opposite atomic charges experience an attractive force,
							and negatively charged electrons orbiting the nucleus are attracted to positively
							charged protons that reside within the nucleus. When we accelerate electrons
							towards a metallic material, the electrons will pass between the atoms in the material,
							and when they pass close to a nucleus, they are deflected from their original path
							towards the nucleus and "braked" by the attractive force they experience
							from the protons in the nucleus. The energy lost by the deceleration
							is released in the form of X-Ray photons, but not all electrons will produce
							photons of equal energy.
					</p>

					<p>
							Consider the following diagram. The closer an electron is the to
							nucleus, the stronger the attractive force it experiences from the
							protons in the nucleus (illustrated by intensity of the red),
							and as a result, the more deflection it will
							experience as it passes by the nucleus. The more deflection it
							experiences, the more kinetic energy of the electron is lost as it
							decelerates, and the released X-Ray photon will be of a higher energy level.
							This also implies that we can infer that the maximum possible photon energy
							is the same as the energy of the incident electron, as we cannot
							release more energy than the kinetic energy of the electron passing
							near the nucleus.
					</p>
					<img src="images/braking_radiation_2.png" alt="braking radiation 2" title="braking radiation 2" class="diagram"/>

					<p>
							We note that the energy level of the released X-Ray photon is inversely proportional to
							the electron's distance from the nucleus, in other words, the farther
							away from the nucleus the electron is, the lower the energy of the photon
							released. If we mark the regions around the nucleus as bands of concentric
							circles, we find that the regions farthest from the nucleus are also the
							regions with the largest area, this means that there is a higher probability
							that an electron will pass through the outer spheres of the nucleus's influence (creating more photons),
							and a lower chance that an electron will pass very near the nucleus itself (creating less photons).
							With the two observations, we can conclude that as the photon energy decreases,
							the number of photons produced increases.
					</p>

					<img src="images/braking_radiation_3.png" alt="braking radiation 2" title="braking radiation 3" class="diagram"/>

					<p>
						Combining our above knowledge, we notice that the Bremsstrahlung spectrum
						has a maximum photon energy equal to the maximum possible kinetic energy of the incident electrons.
						Up until that point, the number of photons produced increases as the photon energy
						decreases.
					</p>

					<p>
						Recall from the previous lesson that the energy of a photon is:
						$$E=hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
						We know that the maximum possible energy of a X-Ray photon is equal
						to the maximum kinetic energy of the accelerated electron, which can
						be found using the below equation:
						$$V\text{ - accelerating voltage}$$
						$$e = 1.6x10^{-19}C\text{ - charge of an electron}$$
						$$KE_{electron} = qV = eV$$
						Combining the two equations, we can form the two equations that
						describe the relationship between accelerating voltage and maximum
						X-Ray photon frequency and minimum wavelength respectively:
						$$hf_{max} = eV$$
						$$\frac{hc}{\lambda_{min}} = eV$$
					</p>

					<h1><a name="characteristic" id="characteristic"></a>Characteristic X-Rays</h1>

					<p>
							Characteristic X-Rays are named as such because their X-Rays are of sharp, discrete
							frequencies that are unique to different metals, and can be used to identify them.
					</p>

					<p>
							The process of Characteristic X-Ray production involves the accelerated electrons (red)
							colliding with an electron in the inner valence shell (blue) of the atoms.
							If the electron possess kinetic energy greater than or equal to
							the binding energy of the orbiting electron, it is freed from the
							inner electron shell, leaving a vacancy. Outer electrons (green)
							drop shells in order to fill the vacancy, in the process giving up energy.
							This lost energy is emitted in the form of Characteristic X-Rays.
					</p>

					<img src="images/characteristic_radiation_1.png" alt="characteristic radiation 1" title="characteristic radiation 1" class="diagram"/>

					<p>
							In X-Ray spectroscopy, on top of traditional atomic notation of KLMN shells,
							we additionally use Siegbahn notation to denote the transitions of electrons
							from upper to lower shells. The first character is an english letter
							representing the final energy level of the transition (KLMN). The
							second character is a subscript greek letter, alpha or beta, representing
							a transition of 1 or 2 levels respectively.<br>
							For example, when an electron falls from the M-shell to the K-shell, the X-ray photon emitted is referred to as a K-beta X-Ray. <br>
							The below diagram summarises the different notations.
					</p>

					<p>
						Because electrons at different electron shells can be dislodged, and
						the vacancies created by the electron can be filled from different upper
						electron levels, any given material can result in many different Characteristic X-Ray
						energies. Because the X-Ray photon's energy is based on the energy lost
						in each transition, alpha photons have the least energy and longest wavelength. <br>
					</p>
					<p>
						The likelihood of an K-alpha X-Ray being formed by
						L-shell electron filling the K-shell vacancy is
						higher than a K-beta X-Ray being formed by an M-shell electron
						filling the K-shell vacancy, and likewise also applies to L-alpha and L-beta
						X-Rays. This results in the intensity of each of the discrete energy levels
						being different, with the intensity of K-alpha X-Rays being greater than
						that of X-beta X-Rays. When we measure the discrete wavelengths where these
						peaks in intensity occur, we call them spectral lines.
					</p>

					<h1><a name="spectrum" id="spectrum"></a>X-Ray Spectrum</h1>


					<p>
							When we measure the different wavelength of the photons and plot their
							respective intensities, we refer to the graph as the X-Ray spectrum.
							Below is the spectrum of the X-rays emitted by an X-ray tube with
							a rhodium target, operated at 60 kV.

					<p>
							From our knowledge of the previous chapters, we notice that
							the peaks in the spectrum (spectral lines) are the result of Characteristic X-Ray
							photons, with K-alpha intensity being much higher than K-beta intensity. <br>
							The continous distribution of radiation is due to Bremsstrahlung,
							with the distinctive curve at the start before it plateaus due to
							the relationship we established earlier, that the number of photons produced
							(and hence intensity) increases as the photon energy
							(which has an inverse relationship with wavelength) decreases.
							The plateau itself is due to low-energy photons (lower energy = higher wavelength)
							being filtered out by the anode surface, x-ray tube window, or added
							filter material (usually aluminium). In practice, low-energy photons
							do not contribute to the formation of X-Ray images, and only serve to
							irradiate the subject (usually human), which is undesirable.
