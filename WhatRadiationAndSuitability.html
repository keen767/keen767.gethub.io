					<h1><a name="WhatRXRays" id="WhatRXRays"></a>What are X-Rays?</h1>

					<p>
							X-rays are a actually photons of pure energy, this is similar to that of gamma rays.
							X-rays can be produced naturally or by machines using electricity. So what are photons anyway?
							Well photons are massless packets of energy that behave like particles, these particles have different levels of energy
							and their energy goes by the formula shown below.
							$$E=hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
							Where E is the energy of the photon, h is a constant known as planks constant and f is the frequency of the particle.

					<h1><a name="DiffXRayGammaRay" id="DiffXRayGammaRay"></a>Differences between x-rays and gamma rays</h1>

					<img src="images/backgrounds/menu.jpg" alt="AN EXAMPLE IMAGE" title="AN EXAMPLE IMAGE" class="articleimg" />

					<p>
						X-rays and gamma rays actually have the same basic properties.
						The main difference being that they come from different parts of the atom.
						X-rays are emitted from processes outside the nucleus, but gamma rays originate inside the nucleus.
						Also, since x-rays have less energy then gamma rays, they are comparatively less penetrating.
					</p>

					<h1><a name="UsesofX" id="UsesofX"></a>Uses of x-rays</h1>

					<p>
							X-rays have high frequency (The sound kind, not how often it appears) and can carry a good amount of energy, as such it has high tissue penetration.
							Due to this high tissue penetration, they are highly suited for medical imaging. Some of you may question,
							why we hear about gamma rays not really being used for medical imaging?
							After all as said early, they have the same basic properties and x-rays are less penetrating.
							Actually, we use both x-rays and gamma rays for radiology,
							gamma rays are used in nuclear medicine, as well as in court medicine.
							Gamma rays are also used for both diagnosis and prevention, they are commonly used for internal imaging.
							X-rays are also used for medical imaging.
							These all allow for pictures of the body's internal structure to be produced.
					</p>

					<p>
							So why do we use x-rays more often than gamma rays when it comes to medical imaging?

						1. Large potential difference is applied
						2. Acceleration of electrons
						3. Collision between electrons
						4. Electrons drop down to fill inner shell
						5. Energy is released as X-Ray


						# What is the wavelength of the most energetic X-Rays produced by a tube operating at 10.0kV

						eV = hc / lambda

						1. [x] 1.24e-10 m
						1. [ ] 0.96e-13 m
						1. [ ] 1.37e-11 m
						1. [ ] 1.98e-29 m
