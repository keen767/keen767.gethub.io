				      <p>
							There are several modalities in radiology that use X-ray tubes, such as
							<span class="tooltip" title="The science dealing with X-rays and other high-energy radiation, especially the use of such radiation for the diagnosis and treatment of disease.">Radiology</span>,
          <span class="tooltip" title="Fluoroscopy can be used for diagnosing (finding out the cause of) a health problem such as heart or intestinal disease.">Fluoroscopy</span>,
          <span class="tooltip" title="Mammography is specialized medical imaging that uses a low-dose x-ray system to see inside the breasts.">Mammography</span>, and

						        	In all cases, the function and components of the X-Ray tube is widely similar.
											An x-ray tube is an electronic vacuum tube with components contained within a glass or metal enclosure.
											The x-ray tube, however, is a special type of vacuum tube that contains two electrodes: the cathode and the anode.
											It is relatively large, perhaps 30 to 50 cm long and 20 cm in diameter.
											The glass enclosure is made of Pyrex glass to enable it to withstand the tremendous heat generated. <br>

						<p>
							The <SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold">cathode</SPAN>
							is typically a small tungsten filament similar to that of an incandescent light bulb,
							it creates free electrons through thermionic emissions.
						</p>


						<p class="box">

							<SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold">Thermionic emission</SPAN>

							(a.k.a. the Edison effect) happens when the metal gets so hot that the thermal vibrational energy overcome the electrostatic forces holding electrons to the surface.
							<br> <br>

							<img src="images/TE schematic.png" alt="" class="diagram">
							<br>
							<span class="label">Thermionic Effect Diagram</span> <br>

							When current flows throught the metal, the metal heats up.
							The hot metal is now surrounded by a "cloud" of electrons, which are 'boiling' off the metal surface and falling back again.
							This is what is called a "<SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold">space charge effect</SPAN>".
							<br>
							<br>


							<img src="images/TE diagram.jpg" alt="" class="diagram"> <br>
							<span class="label"> Graph of Emission Current against Temperature</span> <br>
						</p>

						<p>
							Electrons get absorbed at the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold">anode</SPAN>,
							and this is where X-rays are produced. <br>
						</p>


						<ul>
							<SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold">The anode must serve three functions in an x-ray tube:</SPAN>
							<li> It acts as an electrical conductor, receiving electrons emitted by the cathode.</li>
							<li> It provides mechanical support for the target.</li>
							<li> It is a good thermal dissipator, such that more than 99% of the KE from the projectile electrons get converted into heat, which needs to also dissipate quickly</li>
						</ul> <br>

						<p>
							The <SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold">target</SPAN> is the area of the anode struck by the electrons from the cathode.
							The target is typically made of tungsten due to its high atomic number and high melting point (3,422 Â°C).
						</p>

							<img src="images/xray tube anode types.jpg" alt="">

						<p>
							<!-- Stationary vs Rotating anode -->
							There are two types of anodes, <SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold">stationary and rotating</SPAN>.
							Stationary anodes have a simple design, low heat capacity, and has a low exposure.
							While a rotating anode with a long focal track spreads out electrons over a larger area.
							As rotational speeds of the rotating anode reaches up to 12,000 rpms, the heat is spread out,
							giving the complex design has a higher heat capacity and higher exposure. <br>
							As the higher exposure of the rotating anode gives higher quality imaging, it typically lends itself to being used in X-ray tubes.
						</P>

						<img src="images/xray tube IM.jpg" alt="">
						<p>
							The rotating anode is powered by an <SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold">induction motor</SPAN>
							that consists of two principal parts separated from each other by the glass or metal enclosure.
							Outside the enclosure consists of a bunch of electro-magnets called the stator,
							while the rotor lies protected in the enclosure.
