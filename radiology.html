					This lesson covers real life applications of X-Rays in radiology, specifically MRI scans
					and Fluoroscopy. We also explore the biological effects of X-ray exposure,
					short-term to patients and long-term to medical staff.

					<p>
							Radiology is the branch of medicine that uses X-Ray imaging technology
							in order to diagnose and provide treatment for diseases. We know that
							when X-Ray photons strike an object, depending on the density of
							the object, some of the X-rays will be absorbed, while letting
							the others pass through.
					</p>



					<p>
							This is the principle upon which we can form images of our body's
							internal structure. We pass X-Rays through our body, aimed at a
							photographic plate. Muscle and soft tissue are much less dense,
							and hence allow the X-Rays to pass through them, hitting the photographic
							plate and turning certain regions black. Dense tissue like bones
							will absorb more X-Rays, showing up as white on the photographic
							plate.
					</p>

					<p>
							Pictured on the right is a radiograph of one of the authors of this website.
							Low density material such as air is represented as black on the
							final image. Very dense material such as metal or contrast
							material is represented as white. Bodily tissues are varying
							degrees of grey, depending on density, and thickness.
					</p>


					<h1><a name="X-Ray Exposure" id="X-Ray Exposure"></a>X-Ray Exposure</h1>

					<p>
							There are of course health considerations when working with X-Rays,
							they are a form of ionizing radiation, and ionizing radiation possibly creates
							double-strand breaks in cells that allow excess DNA, leftover from natural processes
							such as genomic DNA repairs or viral infections, to enter and cause cellular mutations.
							These mutations in our DNA might lead to cancer later in life. For this reason,
							X-rays are classified as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization.
					</p>

					<p>
							Some body parts are more susceptible to the random damaging effects
							of radiation. These are generally tissues with rapidly dividing cells,
							for example, radiation dose to the stomach is over 20 times more
							likely to result in a fatal cancer than the same dose to bone.
					<p>
							Dose dependent biological effects become measurable above 50mSv (millisieverts) and a whole body dose of
							greater than 10Sv (sieverts) is universally lethal.

							Singapore's background radiation level is about 0.1 micro-Sievert per hour (µSv/h) = 0.0001mSv.
							Diagnostic investigations can involve doses ranging from 0.02mSV (chest X-ray) to 15.4mSv (CT abdomen).
							This means that a chest X-ray amounts to 0.02/0.0001=200 hours of background radiation and a
							CT abdomen is equivalent to 15.4/0.0001=154000 hours=17.580 years of background radiation!
					</p>

					<p>
						Despite all this, the benefits of radiographic technology far outweigh the
						potential negative consequences of using them.
