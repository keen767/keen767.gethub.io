								We are a group of physics students from NUS High School of Math and Science studying the
								AP physics 2 syllabus, and made this website as part of a project of developing a
								website on the topic of X-Rays and radio imaging.
						</p>

						<p>
								We have compiled content from many different sources regarding the physics of X-Rays and
								radiology in hopes that this will help in your learning and understanding of the
								nature of X-Rays.
						</p>

						<p>
								This website was made with a template provided by <a href="http://www.sixshootermedia.com">6ix Shooter Media</a>
								and hosted by Github Pages.
