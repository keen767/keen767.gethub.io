						<h1><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Introduction</h1>
						<p>
								Hello and welcome to X-Ray Masterclass.
						</p>

						<p>
								This is your definitive guide to everything related to the AP Physics topic of X-Rays and more.
								We cover history of the discovery of X-Rays, how they are formed at the atomic level, the formulas required to calculate their many properties,
								and the applications of X-Rays in the medical field of radiology.
						</p>

						<p>
								The content in this website is tailored towards AP physics students, and as such we assume preliminary understanding of
								subatomic particles (nucleus and electrons) and rudimentary familiarity with waves (frequency and wavelength). While
								the content is designed with AP physics students in mind, fret not if you are worried the content will be
								too advanced, we provide comprehensive introductions to the radiation physics required to understand everything.
  						</p>
